But what happens when we look at the world’s real odds of apocalyptic mayhem and it’s most likely causes according to… science instead of sci-fi? Meet Dr. Shahar Avin, a researcher at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER) in Europe.

What would our beloved horror movies look like IF they were reflecting reality?"
