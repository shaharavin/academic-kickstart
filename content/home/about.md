# Biography

I'm a Postdoc Researcher at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER) at the University of Cambridge. My research examines challenges and opportunities in the implementation of risk mitigation strategies, particularly in areas involving high uncertainty and heterogeneous or conflicting interests and incentives. Mixing anthropological methods and agent-based modelling, I work with other CSER researchers and others in the existential risk community to identify and design opportunities for impact.

Prior to CSER, going backwords in time, I:
* worked at Google for a year as a mobile/web software engineer,
* wrote a philosophy of science PhD on the allocation of public funds to research projects
* did a physics/HPS undergrad
* served in the IDF
* was a very geeky underaged human (now no longer underaged)

I've also worked at and with several startups over the years.
