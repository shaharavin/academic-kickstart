Shahar Avin is a senior researcher associate at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk (CSER). He works with CSER researchers and others in the global catastrophic risk community to identify and design risk prevention strategies, through organising workshops, building agent-based models, and by frequently asking naive questions.

Prior to CSER, Shahar worked at Google for a year as a mobile/web software engineer. His PhD was in philosophy of science, on the allocation of public funds to research projects. His undergrad was in physics and philosophy of science, which followed a mandatory service in the IDF. He has also worked at and with several startups over the years.
