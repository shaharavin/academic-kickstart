abstract = "This Briefing Paper from CETaS and the Centre for Long-Term Resilience aims to provide a clear framework to inform the UK Governmentâ€™s approach to understanding and responding to the risks posed by Artificial Intelligence (AI). The Government has shown increasing ambition to take a globally leading role in AI safety, but currently the UK is inadequately resilient to the risks posed by AI. Now is the time to act decisively on the policy interventions required to address those risks."
